    "\n",
    "The exam is open-book, meaning that you may use any class notes, readings, slides, and problem sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use the internet only for programming-related queries such as looking up documentation; you may NOT use the internet to help with any of the written answers.\n",

    "### Questions/clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about the exam, please send them to gsi-cogsci131@lists.berkeley.edu. We will post any necessary clarifications to bCourses. Piazza will be frozen for the duration of the final. Also note that the GSIs can only give clarifications; we cannot help you solve the problems."

Make sure you run these cells for each part of the exam before submitting your assignment. **If your code does not pass the test cells, you will NOT receive credit.** In general, you can expect that if your code passes the test cells, then you will receive full credit for the coding part of your answer. \n",

    "However, the instructors reserve the right to deduct points if your code does not conform to the spirit of the problem. For example, if we ask you to write code to compute the sum of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, we expect a solution like `answer = np.sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])`, NOT `answer = 15`. The reason for this is that if you just supply us with a number, we cannot determine how you got that number: just like in a math class where you need to show your work, we want to see all the code you used to find the solution."
